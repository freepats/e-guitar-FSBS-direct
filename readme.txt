Electric Guitar FSBS bridge pickups (direct)
--------------------------------------------

Version 2022-09-11

Sound bank made by direct sampling a Fender electric guitar (basic model)
using an audio interface with dedicated instrument inputs.

These sounds are direct recordings of the raw signal of an electric guitar and
they are not expected to be used stand-alone, the output should be connected
to a guitar amplifier, either a hardware setup or a software guitar processor
and effects rack. For GNU/Linux operating systems, Guitarix is an excellent
virtual amplifier that can be used to complement this sound bank.

Alternative sound banks are available, where amplifier and effects are already
included into the samples. Please visit FreePats web pages for updates and
